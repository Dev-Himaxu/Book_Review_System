## Features

- CRUD operations for books (Authenticated users can add books)
- Retrieve books with pagination and optional filters (author, genre)
- Search books by title or author (case-insensitive partial search)
- Submit, update, and delete reviews for books (Authenticated users only, one review per user per book)
- View book details including average rating and paginated reviews
